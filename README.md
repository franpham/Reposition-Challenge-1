# Reposition students problem

_if you plan on doing both levels, can you do level 2 first?_

## Level 1

1. Create a solution1.js source file.
1. In solution1, create a function that takes in an array of student objects, and returns an array with each student in an order that follows the following rules.
  a. each student must move to a new position
  a. each student must move ta a position that is not a neghboring position of the original position (position 5 cannot move to position 4 or 6)
  a. each student must move to a position that is not next to either original neighboring positions (edges, 0 and 10 only have one neighbor)
1. export the function as a module
1. import the source file `students.js`
1. pass the array from `students.js` into your function and display the results.

## Level 2

1. write tests that ensure that your function returns the desired results
